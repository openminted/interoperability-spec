= Introduction

The scenarios in this document aim to highlight TDM/NLP interoperabiliy aspects within particular
use-cases. They approach the topic from the point of view of four different areas corresponding 
to interoperability working groups in the OpenMinTeD project:

* WG1 - Resource metadata
* WG2 - Language resources
* WG3 - IPR and licensing
* WG4 - Annotation and workflows

The scenario descriptions are structured as follows:

* Description
* Relevance to the WG
* Relevance other WGs
* Relevance in general
* Approaches
* Open questions
