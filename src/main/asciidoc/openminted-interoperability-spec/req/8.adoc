== Components must associate themselves with categories defined by the OpenMinTeD project

With a large number of components, it can be difficult for workflow creators to find the most appropriate components if they can only search for components by name or by reading each component's documentation.  Having components associated with categories would enable workflow creators to easily search for a particular type of component (e.g. part-of-speech tagger) as well as allowing associated UI tooling an additional way of ordering lists of components on-screen.

|Product|Version|Compliant|Justification|Status

| Alvis
| 0.5rc
| Partial
| Alvis does not categorize the components but can follow a categorization schema.
| Draft

| ARGO
| 0.5
| Partial
| Currently Argo puts components into 4 categories (reader, writer, analytics, web service), however the bulk of the components reside within the analytics category, and the only method for users to find a relevant component is to search through the entire list within the UI.  The reader, writer and analytics components are identified by examining their UIMA descriptor files (looking for either the collectionReaderDescription, casConsumerDescription and analysisEngineDescription elements).  Interactive components are identified by the `interactive` flag in their Argo descriptor file (An Argo descriptor is a complimentary file to the UIMA descriptor, providing additional information.  For example, it can help Argo select the most appropriate UI widget for configuration parameters, such as strings that represent types or files.)

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| No
| DKPro Core components try to follow a naming scheme, e.g. `XxxReader`, `XxxWriter`, `XxxSegmenter`, `XxxPosTagger`, etc. Categories can be derived off these names in many cases. In some cases, components fulfill multiple purposes, e.g. TreeTagger does lemmatization and POS tagging. A second source off which category information could be derived are the input/output types declared by the components, e.g. `Sentence`, `Token`, etc. There is no direct associated with any (external) categorization system.

| GATE
| 8.5-SNAPSHOT
| Partial
| GATE components can be categorised using the new OMTD-SHARE Java annotations. If these are used then the component category will correctly appear in the OMTD-SHARE descriptor file produced during the build process. However, currently none of our core plugins are so annotated.
| Draft

| ILSP
| 1.2.1
| No
| By convention we package all readers, exporters, and instantiations of uimafit pipelines as three different projects. A package is also used for uima service clients. The rest of the packages concern analyzers and follow an ilsp-nlp-XXX naming scheme, with XXX being a string like lemmatizer or depparser.
