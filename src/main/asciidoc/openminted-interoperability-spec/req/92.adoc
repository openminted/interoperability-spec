* <<REQ-51>>

The license text of a resources should be included with a packaged resource. The exact way this is
done depends on the type of packaging.

.ZIP files

In ZIP files, the license should be located at the root of the file in a plain text file called
`LICENSE`. The file may optionally have the suffix `.txt`. If multiple licenses apply, all of them
should be concatenated in that file.

.Java JAR files

In Java JAR files, the license should be located in a plain text file `META-INF/LICENSE`. The file
may optionally have the suffix `.txt`. If multiple licenses apply, all of them should be concatenated
in that file.

.Docker 

*FIXME*

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.

| Alvis
| 0.5rc
| Partial
| Exist for the corpus

| ARGO
| 0.5
| Partial
| Some existing Argo components contain a LICENSE.txt file, however this is not always the case and these license files don't get included with the packaged components.

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| Partial
| JAR files for DKPro Core components contain a LICENSE.txt file. JAR files for models so far usually do not contain a LICENSE.txt file. 
| Draft

| GATE
| 8.2
| No
| Some plugins do do this, but in general it's not the case. The next version of GATE will use maven for plugin build/distribution at which time the license will be listed in the pom.xml. We don't currently envisage adding the full license text into the META-INF folder, mostly as users will never have access to it, but information from the pom.xml may well be exposed.
