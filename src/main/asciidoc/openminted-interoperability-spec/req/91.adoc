* <<REQ-13>>

It is customary for resource creators/owners to ask for scholarly attribution through the citation of publications; these are usually publications that describe the resource, its functionalities, design principles etc. 
The OMTD-SHARE metadata schema includes a specific metadata element for this, namely 'mustBeCitedWith', which is recommended and can be filled in with 

* the identifier of a publication (‘publicationIdentifier’) or 

* a free text field (‘documentUnstructured’), which can be used for recording a whole bibliographic record. 

The preferred option is adding the identifier of the publication (with the appropriate attributes).

|====
|Name|Element/Attribute|Type|Strength|Repeatability|Description

|publicationIdentifier
|element
|xs:string
|mandatory (choice with documentUnstructured)
|yes
|Reference to a PID, DOI or any kind of identifier used for the publication; must obligatorily be used with the attribute _publicationIdentifierSchemeName_

|publicationIdentifierSchemeName
|attribute
|open controlled vocabulary
|mandatory
|no
|Reference to the publication scheme that has been used for the identifier (e.g. DOI, handle, arXiv, bibcode etc.); the list of values includes the most widespread schemes used for publications

|schemeURI
|attribute
|URI
|mandatory when applicable
|no
|Reference to a URI of the resource scheme that has been used for the identifier, providing more information about the resource scheme

|documentUnstructured
|element
|xs:string
|mandatory (choice with publicationIdentifier)
|no
|Used either as a free text description or as an unstructured (free form) presentation of a bibliographic record; alternative to the structured presentation of a document

Further specifications according to this requirement:

* for components, in accordance with <<REQ-2>>, this  information should be provided in the component metadata. The recommended way to do this is by adding Java annotations in the GATE and UIMA descriptors specific to this element. We recommend the usage of the @citation element. Within this element the author should place one or more bibliographic records, preferably in bibtex format.

NOTE: For clarification reasons, it is noted that this relation is different from the ‘datacite:relationType’ _isCitedBy_, which records the actual citation of the resource in various publications; in fact, it is closer to the _isDocumentedIn_ and the _dc:bibliographicCitation_ but this relation type doesn’t highlight the preferential nature of the citable publication.

| Occasionally, pointers to relevant papers are included in the documentation or metadata of components,
but this information is only indicative. The DKPro Core website explicitly asks users to look up relevant papers for the components they use - or more specifically - the tools they wrap and the models that are used with them.

| GATE

| No
| There may be citations within the documentation but nothing explicit. If there is a java annotation that could be used then we'd have no issue with adding this, where appropriate, to existing components and recommending it for future component development
