It is mandatory to include an indication of the licensing terms under which a resource is made accessible. In the OMTD-SHARE schema, this can be implemented in one of the following ways, in preferential order:

* Selection from a list of values of the most popular standard licences in the 'licence' element (link to the controlled vocabulary to be provided) and indication of the licence version in the 'version' element;

* For licences not included in the list, selection of the 'other' value in the 'licence' element and usage of the elements 'nonStandardLicenceTermsName' to provide a name for the licence and 'nonStandardLicenceTermsURL' to provide a link to the licence text or 'nonStandardLicenceTermsText' to add the licence text.

* For legacy resources that come without a clear indication of licence but which can be classified into one of the Rights Statements discussed in OpenMinTeD, the last option is to use the element 'rightsStmtName' and 'rightsStmtURL' (with a link to the definition of the rights statement)

NOTE: For resources that are produced through OpenMinTeD operations (e.g. user queries for creating corpora, resources annotated by workflows in the platform etc.), the user will be shown an aggregation of all licence values of the resources.

To fulfill the above requirements, further recommendations:

* Components coming from Maven repositories: the wrapper element <license> with nested elements <name> & <url> for the full title of the licence (mentioning also version) and for the url respectively must be obligatorily filled in; if possible, use of one of the OpenMinTeD recommended licences is preferred.

* Resources from the Linked Data community can use the dc:license or dc:rights elements to provide a link to the licence text or a licence name. The 'dc:license' (which requires a licence document) is preferable to 'dc:rights' (which can be filled in with a free text statement); it is essential to also attach the full legal document containing the licensing terms to the packaged resource and add the "licenseURI" in the metadata description.
