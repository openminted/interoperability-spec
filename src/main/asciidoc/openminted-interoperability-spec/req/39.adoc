Content resources must include metadata on their format (e.g. XML, DOCX etc.), preferrably in accordance to the IANA mimetype; where applicable, further information on the specific type of the format (e.g. XML compatible with a specific schema XSD) should be included; when the resource is the output of an OMTD operation, the metadata should automatically receive the appropriate format values
