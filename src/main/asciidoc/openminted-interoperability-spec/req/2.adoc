To avoid implementation and metadata getting out-of-sync, the metadata have to be closely integrated
with the component source code such that e.g. parameter names and types are obtained directly from
the implementation (cf. <<uimafit>>).

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.
