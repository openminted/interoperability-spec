Each GATE or UIMA component is a Java class and as such can be uniquely identified by its classname. Components are to be distributed via Maven and versioning information will be recorded as part of the link:https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates[POM].
Together these two sources provide the following information

|===
| Coordinate | Description | Source

| groupId 
| Group ID of the Maven artifact containing the component
| Maven POM

| artifactId 
| Artifact ID of the Maven artifact containing the component
| Maven POM

| version 
| Version of the Maven artifact containing the component
| Maven POM

| packaging 
|  *optional* Packaging of the Maven artifact containing the component
| Maven POM

| classifier 
| *optional* Classifier of the Maven artifact containing the component
| Maven POM

| class 
| Name of the class implementing the component
| UIMA resource specifier or GATE CREOLE Metadata (derived from classname)
|===

In UIMA, the identifier has the following forms depending on the presence of the optional coordinates:

.Component identifiers
----
mvn:{groupId}:{artifactId}:{version}#{class}
mvn:{groupId}:{artifactId}:{classifier}:{version}#{class}
mvn:{groupId}:{artifactId}:{packaging}:{classifier}:{version}#{class}
----

.Example
----
mvn:my.organization.tdm:dictionary-tools:1.0.1#my.organization.tdm.DictionaryLookup
----

NOTE: The version is also available from the UIMA resource specifier. It must be in sync with the version specified in the Maven POM. The link:https://uima.apache.org/d/uimafit-current/tools.uimafit.book.html#tools.uimafit.maven[uimaFIT Maven plugin] goal `generate` ensures this by determining the version in the generated UIMA resource specifier from the version specified in the Maven POM. The `overrideComponentVersion` and `componentVersion` settings in the uimaFIT MAven plugin must *not* be used. Neither must the uimaFIT `@ResourceMetaData` annotation be used to manually provide a version.
