The component metadata should be provided in such a way that it is separable from the component.
I.e. despite the canonical source of much of the metadata being the source code (and in a second
instance, the compiled code), it should not be necessary to inspect the source code (or compiled
code) to access the metadata or to actually invoke the component. Instead, the component should be
accompanied by a metadata file that was automatically generated during build time. Component
repositories for example should use this file when looking for component metadata. The file should
be at a well-known location within the component artifact.

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.

| Alvis XML exist separately from the code. Each XML descriptor is next to the component class it describes. By convention, the name of the XML file is created by appending the keyword "Doc" to the end the component name, for example GeniaTaggerDoc.xml for the component named GeniaTagger.

| using uimaFIT to automatically generate UIMA XML descriptors. XML descriptors as always next to
the respective component classes. Pointers to all XML descriptors as stored in at
`META-INF/org.apache.uima.fit/components.txt` within the respective JAR files. Maven POM
files are also embedded in the JARs under `META-INF/maven/.../pom.xml`.

| The standard plugin build process now produces a standalone XML file containing all the metadata supplied by the Java anootations. This is stored in `META-INF/gate/creole.xml`. Other metadata can be obtained from the Maven pom.xml which is also bundled inside the jar file.
