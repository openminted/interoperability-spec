This requirement can be fulfilled with implementation of requirement 75. The output format of UIMA components can be
defined using @MimeTypeCapability annotation.

NOTE: This can be mapped to the OMTD-SHARE schema elements _mimeType_, which should take values from the IANA mimetype controlled vocabulary, and, in case this is not sufficient, _dataFormatSpecific_ (a free text field for specifying a name of a data format) and  _documentationURL_ (link to a URL with more infomation about the format), all embedded in _outputResourceInfo_.

| At present users can only deduce the output format of a UIMA component from either the name of a component or its textual description.  Argo components will eventually be able to use the @MimeTypeCapability annotation when uimaFIT becomes a first-class citizen within Argo.
