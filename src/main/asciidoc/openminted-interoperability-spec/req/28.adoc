Processing components should be downloadable. The user should be able to choose on which infrastructure to run them, e.g. to ensure that the processed data does not leave a particular institution. Components that are not downloadable should clearly indicate that (e.g. using a "I am a service" flag).

| components are created by loading a plugin from a given URL. This results in the jar files being downloaded to the local machine in some way (dependent on a number of factors) and then added to the JVM. This means all processing occurs where the framework is being run and data does not have to leave the local machine.
