* <<REQ-96>>

All resources must be assigned an identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle PID, URI etc.) that allows them to be uniquely, non-ambiguously and persistently identified. 

Resources that already have a PID, can include this in their metadata descriptions, in the element 'identifier'/'publicationIdentifier' using the 'resourceIdentifierSchemeName'/'publicationIdentifierSchemeName' attribute to specify the corresponding scheme, for instance:

* publications that already have a DOI can include this in the 'publicationIdentifier' with the value _doi_ 'publicationIdentifierSchemeName'; DOIs are the recommended identifiers for publications

* datasets, lexica, etc. that already have a DOI or a Handle id, will include these in the 'resourceIdentifier' with 'resourceIdentifierSchemeName' _doi_ or _hdl_ respectively

* knowledge resources that come from the Linked Data community and have a URI, can encode this in the 'resourceIdentifier' with 'resourceIdentifierSchemeName' _uri_

* s/w components, in accordance to <<REQ-96>>, can include the component coordinates and add the value _other_ for 'resourceIdentifierScheme' and _https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates_ for 'schemeURI'.

Resources without PIDs will be assigned one according to the procedure specified in the OMTD policies.

NOTE: The element 'identifier' is not reserved for PIDs; it can be used for any kind of identifier, including organization-internal identifiers.
