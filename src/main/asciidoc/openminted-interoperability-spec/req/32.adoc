Version information must be included in the metadata of all resources. 

Note: At this point, we only wish to check whether versioning is represented in the metadata, and the recommended action can be to at least add the last udpate date; however, to ensure interoperability, we need to create guidelines for defining the notion of "version" for the same resource type and promote standardisation of its representation, at least per resource type; we also need to distinguish between versions of the metadata records and versions of the resources themselves
