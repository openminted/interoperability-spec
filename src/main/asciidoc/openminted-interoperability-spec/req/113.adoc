Where required, components should be available as web services. Two use cases for web services are:
. Where licencing issues prevent the sharing of component source code.
. Where a component has a long intialisation time and a user wishes to reuse the component across multiple workflows.

The omtd web service framework is documented at: https://openminted.github.io/releases/processing-web-services/1.0.0/specification


// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
