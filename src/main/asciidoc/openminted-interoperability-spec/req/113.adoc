Where required, components should be available as web services. Two use cases for web services are:
. Where licencing issues prevent the sharing of component source code.
. Where a component has a long intialisation time and a user wishes to reuse the component across multiple workflows.

The omtd web service framework is documented at: https://openminted.github.io/releases/processing-web-services/1.0.0/specification


// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.

| All GATE components can be provided as a web service via GATE Cloud (see http://cloud.gate.ac.uk). We also have a GATE component which can be embded in any GATE application and which can call GATE Cloud. As this is a normal GATE component it can be included in any OMTD workflow in the normal fashion. Note that this makes the components available as a web service without the need for them to comply with the OMTD web service specification.
