The OMTD-SHARE metadata schema includes the element _componentType_ which can be used for classifying components with values taken from a controlled vocabulary created in the OpenMinTeD project (implemented in SKOS: _pending link_). Each component must be assigned at least one value that best describes its function/task; the assignment of multiple values is possible, allowing for multiple classification. The current set of values focuses on terms of functions/tasks used by NLP and TDM experts, but it will be extended to include terms for non-expert users, catering for the description of integrated complex tasks.

| ARGO

| No
| This requirement could be fulfilled through a change to the specification of the Argo Descriptor file.

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| No
| DKPro Core uses naming conventions for components and DKPro Meta implements a set of rules to derive component types from these naming conventions. However, the component types used by DKPro Meta (and consequently the DKPro Core reference documentation) do not fully correspond to the OMTD-SHARE component types. Also, the component type is not explicitly included with the respective component metadata. It can only be found in the reference documentation.

| 8.2
| No
| There are some naming conventions used with the GATE plugins developed in Sheffield that could be mapped to these categories but in general we don't currently support this requirement in any way.
