When making use of multiple knowledge resources, TDM workflows may need to identify individual knowledge resource elements and knowledge resource schema elements. For example,

* A workflow may need to access information about an element.
* Multiple resources may be harmonised, requiring the relationships between schema elements to be specified.

For this identification purpose, knowledge resource schema elements should be identified with a URI. For Linked Data resources, the following identifiers should  be used:

* JSON-LD - the @id keyword
* RDF/XML - the attributes xml:base, rdf:ID and rdf:about
* XML - the xml:id attribute
