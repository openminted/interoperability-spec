Whether or not a component maybe replicated/scaled up within a workflow by the workflow engine can
be declared in UIMA using the `multipleDeploymentAllowed` flag. If this flag is set to `true`, then
the workflow engine may create multiple instances of the component and run them in parallel with 
the implicit effect that each component may only see a subset of the documents to be processed.
Components that write/export data should set this flag to `false`.

The flag can be set using a uimaFIT annotation on the component class.
