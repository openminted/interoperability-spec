== Components should have a unique identifier and a version number

Components should contain an identifier by which they can be distinguished from each other, in addition to their version. A component registry would then be able to use the combination of the identifier and version number to produce resolvable URLs from which components can be retrieved.

|Product|Version|Compliant|Justification|Status

| Alvis
| 0.5rc
| Partial
| Components (instances of components) are well identified in a workflow but component versioning is not maintained in Alvis.
| Draft

| ARGO
| 0.5
| Partial
| Each component has a unique id under the `uk.ac.nactem.uima` namespace (derived from the path of the UIMA descriptor file within the component's UIMA PEAR file) and a version number specified within the component's UIMA descriptor file.  Argo doesn't currently support the concept of component versions; it only uses whichever version of the component that was installed last.

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| Partial
| Each component has a unique name under the `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro` namespace (basically a Java class name) and a version. The version of a component corresponds to the version of the JAR that contains the version. Each component is contained in a JAR which has a unique Maven GAVC coordinate (e.g. `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core:de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.opennlp-asl:1.8.0:jar`).

| GATE
| 8.5-SNAPSHOT
| Full
| Each component is a Java class and as such has a unique name. The latest version of GATE now loads plugins direct from Maven which means that each component is identified both by it's classname and the version number specified in the pom.xml. Combined these allow the registry to download any version of any component.

| ILSP
| 1.2.1
| Partial
| Each component has a unique name under the `gr.ilsp.nlp` namespace (basically a Java class name) and a version. The version of a component corresponds to the version of the JAR that contains the version. Each component is contained in a JAR which has a unique Maven GAVC coordinate (e.g. `gr.ilsp.nlp:ilsp-nlp-lemmatizer:1.2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`). We try to use some type of semantic versioning (http://semver.org/) for the components, but for some of them this is not so strictly followed.
