Resources must include statistical data (e.g. size of resource, total number of concepts, etc.) which allow monitoring of changes across versions; this will help measuring performance of components with different versions of the same resource. 

NOTE: for version 1 this is set to optional, but for version 2 we should increase the strength for specific metadata elements
