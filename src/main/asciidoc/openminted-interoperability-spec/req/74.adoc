The UIMA framework defines a series of so-called *resource specifiers* contain metadata about 
components. The following types of components and associate resource specifiers are supported by OpenMinTeD:

|===
| Component | Resource specifier

| Reader component
| link:https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-current/references.html#ugr.ref.xml.component_descriptor.collection_processing_parts.collection_reader[CollectionReaderDescription]

| Analysis engine / Writer component
| link:https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-current/references.html#ugr.ref.xml.component_descriptor.aes[AnalysisEngineDescription]
|===

It is expected that these descriptors can be located within the same JAR file that also contains the component they describe. 

The descriptor file should be located next to the Java class file that implements the described component, as it is indicated by the `implementationName` element within the descriptor.

The JAR file must contain a locator file called `META-INF/org.apache.uima.fit/components.txt` which contains pointers to all component descriptor files within a JAR.

classpath*:my/organizations/domain/name/package/Component.xml
----

The locator file should be automatically generated using the `generate` goal of the uimaFIT Maven Plugin as described in the link:https://uima.apache.org/d/uimafit-current/tools.uimafit.book.html#d5e639[uimaFIT documentation].

There must be at most *one* resource specifier per component class. I.e. no two resource specifiers should use the same implementation class.
