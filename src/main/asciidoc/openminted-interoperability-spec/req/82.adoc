Each GATE component is a Java class and as such can be uniquely identified by it's classname. Components are to be distributed via Maven and versioning information will be recorded as part of the link:https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates[POM].
Together these two sources provide the following information

|===
| Coordinate | Description | Source

| groupId 
| Group ID of the Maven artifact containing the component
| Maven POM

| artifactId 
| Artifact ID of the Maven artifact containing the component
| Maven POM

| version
