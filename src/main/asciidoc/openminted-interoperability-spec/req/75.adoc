The uimaFIT library provides Java annotations to embed most types of UIMA metadata as Java annotations directly into the source code of UIMA components.  Particularly relevant for OpenMinTeD are the following uimaFIT annotations:

|===
| uimaFIT annotation |Â Description

| `@MimeTypeCapability`
| For reader components: defines the supported input media types; for writer components: defines the supported output media types. The media type should be an official link:http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml[IANA media type].

| `@TypeCapability`
|  Defines the UIMA types that a component can consume or produce.

| `@LanguageCapability`
| Defines the languages a UIMA component supports. The language should be specified according to
IETF BCP47.

| `@ConfigurationParameter`
| Identifies a component parameter, whether the parameter is mandatory/optional, and may define a default parameter value.
|===

Component metadata other than the ones specified are automatically derived from the source code and generated into a UIMA resource specifier by using the link:https://uima.apache.org/d/uimafit-current/tools.uimafit.book.html#tools.uimafit.maven[uimaFIT Maven plugin] goal `generate`, e.g. the parameter types, implementation name, etc.

The uimaFIT `@ResourceMetaData` annotation *must not* be used as it would interfere with the need of the Maven POM and the UIMA resource specifier metadata being synchronized.

|Product|Version|Compliant|Justification|Status

| ARGO
| 0.5
| Partial
| Some Argo components make use of the uimaFIT annotations, although it is not a requirement of Argo for components to do so.  It is planned that, at some point, we will convert all of our existing components to use uimaFIT annotations.
| Draft

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| Partial
| uimaFIT annotations are used. Language codes are expected to be ISO 639-1. Many components use private media types because many supported formats do not have a corresponding media type.
| Draft

| ILSP
| 1.2.1
| Partial
| The main requirement is that components are described with UIMA XML descriptors, accompanied by UIMA AS deployment descriptors that are used when components are deployed as services.
