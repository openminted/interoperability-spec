GATE provides a number of Javaannotations that can be used to embed CREOLE metadata into the source of GATE components. The annotations relevant to OpenMinTeD are as follows:

|===
| Annotation | Description
| `@CreoleResource` | used to annotate a class to show that it is a GATE resource. The type of resource (processing resource, language resource, etc.) depends upon the class hierarchy.
| `@CreoleParameter` | used to annotate a bean setter method to indicate that the property defines a CREOLE parameter. A parameter can be provided with a default value using the `defaultValue` parameter of the annotation.
|===

All other metadata is determined at runtime via inspection of the class.
