When assembling a workflow and running it, the workflow engine should not require that all data be transferred between the components by passing it through the engine. In the best case, this would only incur a performance overhead. In the worst case, it would require potentially sensitive or proprietary data to leave its source infrastructure, even if the actual analysis components deployed would be deployed on the same infrastructure (that is assuming that the workflow engine does not also run on the same infrastructure). This could e.g. be solved by processing components talking directly to each other.

| Alvis
| Partial
| Alvis uses a shared data structure, the workflow engine is required to manage the data and the modules during the execution steps. However the Alvis modules can be encapsulated with the Alvis engine in a OpenMinTeD workflow.

| DKPro Core
| N/A
| DKPro Core itself does not provide workflow functionality. It's components can in principle be used in a workflow setup where data is passed directly between components, i.e. without going through a central workflow manager. But providing such a manager is beyond the scope of DKPro Core.

| GATE
| partial
| GATE components don't talk to each other, passing data is the job of a pipeline (which is akin to a workflow). However, if within an OpenMinTeD workflow there were a sequence of GATE components then these could be aggregated into a GATE pipeline and deployed as a single unit meaning that data would be kept within the pipeline.
