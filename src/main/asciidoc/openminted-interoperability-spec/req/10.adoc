To assist in the creation of workflows, it would be helpful to know what types of annotations are required and produced by components so that UI tooling can display appropriate warnings when a component is added in an invalid position within a workflow or to help diagnose runtime exceptions whilst running a workflow.

|Product|Version|Compliant|Justification|Status

| Alvis
| 0.5rc
| Partial
| The type system is shared by all the components.
| Draft

| ARGO
| 0.5
| Partial
| Some components declare the types that they input and output, within the component's UIMA descriptor, however this is not always the case and is not required by Argo.
| Draft

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| Full
| Most components declare the input and output types using UIMA *capabilities*. For some components, the types they operate on are configured through parameters.
| Draft

| GATE
| 8.2
| Partial
| GATE does not enforce any type system and as such does not require components to declare in any way their input/output types. That being said it does support XML schemas for defining annotations (and their features) and so it would be possible to bundle a set of schemas with a component (i.e. within the JAR file) that defined the expected input/output annotations. For example, the ANNIE plugin already comes with schemas which define the main NE annotations produced by the application (GATE's terminology for a workflow). We also have a component, the Schema Enforcer, that can be used to ensure that the output of an application strictly conforms to a given set of schemas removing any annotations or features not defined by the schemas. The manual annotation aspects of GATE Developer can also be configured to only allow annotations/features defined by XML schemas to be created.
